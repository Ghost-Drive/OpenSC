# Project Summary


Ghostdrive leverages the benefits of file encryption, decentralized storage, and asset tokenization using a multi-platform application. By harnessing IPFS and Filecoin technologies, it provides an innovative and secure way of storing, sharing, and enabling data exchange markets. Users are in control of their data because of client side encryption and the use of decentralized storage networks.


Moreover, Ghostdrive's capabilities allow for seamless interaction with its services, irrespective of the device or operating system in use. It is designed with both an intuitive user interface and command line tools in order to simplify the process of uploading, accessing, and sharing data. Additionally, it incorporates smart contracts to tokenize data access.


## Impact


The Ghostdrive project addresses several significant pain points that are inherent in traditional data storage methods:


- Privacy Concerns: Traditional data storage services do not support client side encryption, posing serious privacy concerns. They could potentially monitor, share, or misuse user data. Ghostdrive, by providing client side encryption tools, allows users to have full control over their data.


- Reliability of decentralized networks: Using centralized service brings up the problem of point of failure. Ghostdrive mitigates this risk by allowing unlimited replication using IPFS and Filecoin technologies.

## Adoption, Reach, and Growth Strategies

Our target audience is two-fold: individual users seeking secure, private, and flexible data storage solutions, and businesses looking for cost-effective, scalable, and reliable data storage and sharing platforms. This audience is vast as data storage is a fundamental need in our digital age. We are currently engaging with them through direct outreach, digital marketing strategies, and partnerships with relevant organizations and influencers in the tech industry.

Our onboarding strategies are as follows:

First Users: We plan to bring onboard tech enthusiasts from our personal and professional networks who understand the value and potential of decentralized storage. We will provide them with personalized product demonstrations and support to ensure they understand how to get the most out of Ghostdrive and collect their feedback.

Second Wave: To expand our reach, we plan to utilize our partnership with Coin Telegraph, a leading digital media, events, and information services company for the crypto asset and blockchain technology community. This collaboration will help us reach a broader audience. In addition, our dedicated marketing team will run targeted campaigns across various channels like social media, tech forums, and email newsletters. We  have influencer network prepared as well.

## Development Roadmap


### FVM Integration for Access Tokenization

Functionality: The integration of the FVM (Filecoin Virtual Machine) for access tokenization provides the functionality of secure access control. It enables the creation of tokens which are used to access stored data, ensuring that only authorized users can access specific data.
Team Members: Business analyst, UI designer, Frontend developer, Backend developer, Blockchain developer, Quality Assurance Engineer
Funding: $25,000 was allocated for this milestone. This covered the costs of manpower, additional hardware and software requirements, and testing.
Timeline: This milestone will be completed on Aug 10, 2023.

### Multisig file management

Functionality: This milestone will enable multiple-signature file management in Ghostdrive using FVM and other blockchains. This feature will provide enhanced security for file management, requiring multiple parties to authorize file sharing or deletion.
Team Members: Business analyst, UI designer, Frontend developer, Backend developer, Blockchain developer, Quality Assurance Engineer
Funding: This phase requires $40,000. This will cover salaries, additional security measures, potential audits, and any necessary hardware or software.
Timeline: This milestone is expected to take 1 month. Starting from Aug 5, 2023, the expected completion date is September 5, 2023.


### Data access IDO
Functionality: This milestone will enable the Initial Decentralized Offering (IDO) for data access tokens on Ghostdrive. This will provide a mechanism for users to trade access to files and data in a secure, decentralized manner.
Team Members: Business analyst, UI designer, Frontend developer, Backend developer, Blockchain developer, Quality Assurance Engineer
Funding: This phase requires $30,000. This funding will cover salaries, marketing and promotional activities, and other related expenses.
Timeline: This milestone is expected to take 1 month. Starting from September 6, 2023, the expected completion date is October 7, 2023.
